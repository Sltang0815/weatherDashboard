# weatherDashboard
In this application I will be making a weather dashboard. 
I will be making an HTML that has a side section that will be pulling from a weather API, a city of choice, from a form.

The city that I will be searching will be displayed on the right side where it will preview a series of information. I will be pulling the tempurature, the name, wind speed, and the humidity.

in the section of the city information, I will be creating a section with a premade div tag that will be blank as a container for the information to be placed in. For the UV index in need to have another Api link that will allow me to pull the uv index.

in the section below I will be pulling a five day weathering api that will give me the information for the current 3 hours. It will be a separate api from the one day current city.
